The [reconciliation service](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) has been built to restore access of the migrated funds to their owners following the stake migration to the Fetch.ai Main-net.

During the stake migration from ETH to the Fetch Main-net on September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai Main-net. However, some users decided to wait for reconciliation to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete. This resulted in users not being able to access their funds anymore. 
 
!!! warning
    The reconciliation service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds during the stake migration. If you are unable to access your funds for any other reason, then the reconciliation service is not applicable to you and we advise you to do not fill in the form to regain access to your funds.

## Prerequisites

To access to this service you will need to have access to:

* the **Fetch wallet**.

    !!! note
        This must have at least one transaction previously recorded on the network from your address to be able to submit the form. If you have never used it in a transaction before, the reconciliation tool and the network have no  way of knowing your wallet exists and will not allow you to complete the final submission.

* at least **1 Native FET token** in your wallet to pay the transaction fee associated with the reconciliation tool.

* your **Metamask wallet** configured with the address initially used in the original staking platform.

Once your registered transaction is successful and your reconciliation request has been deemed valid, the funds will be automatically distributed to your main-net address on the Fetch wallet.
