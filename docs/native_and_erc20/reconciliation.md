During the stake migration from ETH to the Fetch Main-net on September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai Main-net. However, some users decided to wait for reconciliation to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete. 

The [reconciliation service](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) has been built to restore access of the migrated funds for these users.

!!! warning
    The reconciliation service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds during the stake migration. If you are unable to access your funds for any other reason, for example due to having been hacked, then the reconciliation service is not applicable to you.

## Instructions

Before using the [reconciliation service](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation), make sure the following conditions are satisfied:

* Your [Fetch wallet](/fetch-wallet/) is set up and you have access to it. 

    !!! info
        The address of the account on your Fetch wallet must have recorded at least one transaction on the network. If you have never made a transaction using this address before, the reconciliation tool and the network have no way of knowing your wallet exists and will not allow you to complete the final submission.

* You have at least 1 Native FET token in your wallet to pay the transaction fee associated with the reconciliation tool.

* You have the Metamask wallet set up and configured with the address you used in the original staking platform.

If the above is satisfied, head over to the [reconciliation service](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) and follow the instructions.

Once your registered transaction is successful and your reconciliation request is deemed valid, the funds will be automatically released to the main-net address on your Fetch wallet.
