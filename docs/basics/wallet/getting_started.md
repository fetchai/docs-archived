## Existing Account

### Import an existing account

* Select `Import existing account`
* Enter your mnemonic seed or private key.

### Use ledger hardware wallet

If you have a Ledger hardware wallet and wish to keep your key and mnemonics on that device while using the Fetch wallet:

* Select `Import ledger`
* Give your account a name and set a password. This password will be used the next time you want to use the wallet or make important changes to your account.
* Follow the on-screen instructions.

    Please ensure you keep your mnemonic seed somewhere safe where others cannot access it. If you lose it, your wallet will be inaccessible once you log out. The password for your account should also be kept safe but is not necessary for recovery if you have your mnemonic seed.

    If you lose your password, you need to uninstall and re-install the Fetch wallet and select `Import existing account`. Then use the mnemonic seed for your accounts and choose a new password.
