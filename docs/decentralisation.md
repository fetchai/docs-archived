## What are decentralized systems?

A decentralized system is an interconnected system where no single central entity (individual, organization, or group) is the sole authority. In a decentralized system, control and decision-making is done by those participating in the system where they have (more or less) equal standing in terms of influence. This is in contrast to a centralized system where a central authority is above all others in terms of rights and privileges.

A good example of a decentralized system is the worldâ€™s telephone system; there is no central authority that runs it but numerous participants coordinate together to make it work.

Another great example is when you fly internationally from one place to another. There are numerous participants working together and communicating equitably together to make that a seamless experience. 

**There are two key characteristics of decentralized systems:**

* **Equality of participants**
In a decentralized system, a key feature is that the participants contribute together to the control and decision-making of the system, with each of them taking an active equal role in managing the system. 
* **Lack of central authorities**
It is not that decentralized systems lack authority to make changes to the management of the network, but the authority to do that is distributed among the participants. The system is run by the participants for the benefit of the participants.

## Decentralized vs distributed

These are very easy to get confused, and sometimes it seems they are used interchangeably but they are actually quite different.

A decentralized system is one where there is a lack of central authorities. 

A distributed system is a system in which the physical location of the participants, the servers, the nodes, and whatever other components involved are in different places. So instead of the system being physically all in one place, different parts of the system are located on physically different places and the processing of tasks are shared between them.

The most obvious example of a distributed system is cloud computing, where tasks are shared among numerous computers or a database hosted on more than one computer.

What determines whether a system is decentralized or not is whether or not there is a central authority. What determines whether a system is distributed is whether the processing is done in one or multiple physical locations. 

## Decentralized vs centralized

In a centralized system, there is a central authority that manages the system and makes decisions about how it is run. 
Some examples of centralized systems:
* Expedia: Hotel owners and people looking for hotel rooms connect to each other through Expedia, rather than communicating and transacting directly together.
* Messaging services such as WhatsApp: People communicate with each other through a centrally controlled and owned messaging service.
* Amazon: Buyers and sellers interact commercially through Amazon.

## Why are decentralized systems useful?
Decentralised systems are useful because they solve the issue of trust. Users don't have to trust a central authority, which itself has the motivation to behave in its own interests and agenda but rather the system behaves in the interest of its participants. Which in turns means that participants trust each other more.

## Positive characteristics
There are 4 key positive characteristics of decentralized systems:
* **Democratic** Decentralized systems require participation in order to successfully function, and therefore they are intrinsically democratic systems.
* **Open**
Participants can freely join or leave as they wish,. The system is open to new participants and does not stop existing ones leaving.
* **Public**
Because decentralized systems are managed and run by their participants (Democratic) and anyone can in principle join the system or leave (Open), these systems tend to be public and their inner workings are not kept confidential.
* **Transparent**
In order for the participants of a decentralized system to contribute to its liveliness, they must be aware of how the system works, how it is managed, and so on. Therefore, decentralized systems tend to be quite transparent. 

## Limitations

Decentralized systems are not useful where simplicity and affordability are the key priorities, as there is more complexity in managing a decentralized system and participants have to be willing to actually participate.  

For example a company payroll system would not make sense to decentralize as you want central authority over it and need a system that is simple to manage.

Some of the limitations of decentralised systems:
* **Speed**: Decentralized systems are often slower than centralized systems, as there is no single authority with an interest in making the system as fast as possible and individual participants may not have the incentive to prioritize overall speed of the system. 
* **Efficiency**: Decision making about the system requires participation, which makes it far slower to make changes to the system as it takes time for participants to agree to changes.
* **Control**: As control is shared by participants, controlling and managing the system is more complicated and slower.
* **Privacy**: The requirement for participation inevitably results in a loss of privacy as participants need to actively engage with other participants in order to manage and make decisions about the system.
* **Anonymity**: There are times and situations where participants may actually want to be anonymous, and this is something that decentralized systems do not really allow.
