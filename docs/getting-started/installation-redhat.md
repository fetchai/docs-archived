# Building the Fetch.AI components

Currently, the Fetch.AI Ledger and the open economic framework (OEF) are built and deployed individually. This will change with the main net deployment towards the end of the year.


## Supported platforms

- Red Hat is not currently supported.

``` bash
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
```

Install dependencies:

``` bash
yum install -y sudo
yum install -y make
yum install -y cmake
yum install -y libpng-devel
yum install -y zlib-devel
yum install -y openssl-devel
yum install -y python36-devel (replace 36 with your version of Python3)
yum install -y clang
yum install -y epel-release (dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm)

## Download the ledger code

If you need them, here are the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent" target=_blank>Git SSH key generation instructions.</a>

Clone the repository:

``` bash
cd [working_directory]
git clone https://github.com/fetchai/ledger.git
git checkout release/v0.8.x
```

Update and initialise submodules from the repository root directory:

``` bash
cd ledger
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Make sure you have all the submodules:

``` bash
git submodule status
```

If any submodules are missing, please check your installation.


## Build the ledger

From the `ledger` directory, follow the steps to build the library:

``` bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j constellation
```

You may have memory issues on `make`, so limit the number of cores (we chose 4):

``` bash
make -j 4 constellation
```

If you want, you can build all the libraries:
``` bash
make -j 4
```

For the `etch` simulator, build the `etch` library:
``` bash
make etch
```
