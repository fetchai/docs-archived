While we continue to work on developing separate applications for the Fetch.AI Ledger, Python Ledger API, and the Fetch.AI Open Economic Framework, it's important to make sure all running versions match up.

For example:

``` c++
fetchai/ledger release/v0.7.x
fetchai/ledger-api-py release/v0.7.x
fetchai/oef-search-pluto master
```

Against these, follow the documentation in line with the same versions.

The documentation you are reading now is version:

``` c++
fetchai/docs release/v0.7.x
```
