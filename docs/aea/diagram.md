The framework can be divided into two parts: a) a **core** part that is developed by the Fetch.ai team as well as external contributors, 
and b) **extensions** (also known as **packages**) developed by any developer. This allows for a modular and scalable framework. 
Currently, the framework supports three types of packages which can be added to the core part as modules:

* Skills
* Protocols
* Connections

The following figure illustrates the framework's architecture:
