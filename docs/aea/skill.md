An agent developer writes skills that the framework can call.

When you add a skill with the CLI, a directory is created which includes modules for the `Behaviour,` `Task`, and `Handler` classes as well as a configuration file `skill.yaml`.


## Context

The skill has a `context` object which is shared by all `Handler`, `Behaviour`, and `Task` objects. The skill context also has a link to the agent context. The agent context provides read access to agent specific information like the public key and address of the agent, its preferences and ownership state. It also provides access to the `OutBox`.

This means it is possible to, at any point, grab the `context` and have access to the code in other parts of the skill and the agent.

For example, in the `ErrorHandler(Handler)` class, the code often grabs a reference to its context and by doing so can access initialised and running framework objects such as an `OutBox` for putting messages into.

``` python
self.context.outbox.put_message(to=recipient, sender=self.context.agent_public_key,protocol_id=DefaultMessage.protocol_id, message=DefaultSerializer().encode(reply))
``` 

Importantly, however, a skill does not have access to the context of another skill or protected AEA components like the `DecisionMaker`.


## What to code

Each of the skill classes has three methods that must be implemented. All of them include a `setup()` and `teardown()` method which the developer must implement. 

Then there is a specific method that the framework requires for each class.

### `handlers.py`

There can be none, one or more `Handler` class per skill.

`Handler` classes can receive `Envelope` objects of one protocol type only. However, `Handler` classes can send `Envelope` objects of any type of protocol they require.

* `handle_envelope(self, Envelope)`: is where the skill receives a message contained within an `Envelope` and decides what to do with it.


!!!	Todo
	For example.


### `behaviours.py`

Conceptually, a `Behaviour`  class contains the business logic specific to initial actions initiated by the agent rather than reactions to other events.

There can be one or more `Behaviour` classes per skill. The developer must create a subclass from the abstract class `Behaviour` to create a new `Behaviour`.

* `act(self)`: is how the framework calls the `Behaviour` code. 

!!!	Todo
	For example.


### `tasks.py`

Conceptually, a `Task` is where the developer codes any internal tasks the agent requires.

There can be one or more `Task` classes per skill. The developer subclasses abstract class `Task` to create a new `Task`.

* `execute(self)`: is how the framework calls a `Task`. 

!!!	Todo
	For example.

### Shared classes

The developer might want to add other classes on the context level which are shared equally across the `Handler`, `Behaviour` and `Task` classes. To this end the developer can subclass an abstract `SharedClass`. These shared classes are made available on the context level upon initialization of the AEA.

Say, the developer has a class called `SomeClass`
``` python
class SomeClass(SharedClass):
    ...
```

Then, an instance of this class is available on the context level like so:
``` python
some_class = self.context.some_class
``` 

### Skill config

Each skill has a `skill.yaml` configuration file which lists all `Behaviour`, `Handler`, and `Task` objects pertaining to the skill.

It also details the protocol types used in the skill and points to shared modules, i.e. modules of type `SharedClass`, which allow custom classes within the skill to be accessible in the skill context.

``` yaml
name: echo
authors: Fetch.ai Limited
version: 0.1.0
license: Apache 2.0
url: ""
behaviours:
  - behaviour:
      class_name: EchoBehaviour
      args:
        foo: bar
handlers:
  - handler:
      class_name: EchoHandler
      args:
        foo: bar
        bar: foo
tasks:
  - task:
      class_name: EchoTask
      args:
        foo: bar
        bar: foo
shared_classes: []
dependencies:
  - dependency:
      class_name: EchoDependency
      args:
        foo: bar
        bar: foo
protocols: ["default"]
```


## Error skill

All top level AEA `skills` directories receive a default `error` skill that contains error handling code for a number of scenarios:

* Received envelopes with unsupported protocols 
* Received envelopes with unsupported skills (i.e. protocols for which no handler is registered)
* Envelopes with decoding errors
* Invalid messages with respect to the registered protocol

The error skill relies on the `default` protocol which provides error codes for the above.
