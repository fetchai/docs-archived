AEA applications operate within different orders of trustlessness.

For example, using the AEA weather skill application without a ledger for transactions means that clients must 100% trust the weather station that any data it sends is sufficient, including no data at all.

A step up, if you run the weather skill application on a ledger system then the client must again trust the weather station to send sufficient data. However, all transactions are recorded so there is some data verifiability.

Crucially, the weather station does not need to trust the weather client as it can observe the transaction taking place on the public ledger.

An app could expand trustlessness even further by implementing a third party escrow contract.

Finally, in the case of (non-fungible) token transactions where there is an atomic swap, full trustlessness is apparent.
