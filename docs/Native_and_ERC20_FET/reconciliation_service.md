# Reconciliation service

During the _stake migration from ETH to the Fetch Mainnet_ on September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai Mainnet. However, some users decided to opt to wait for reconciliation to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete. This resulted in users not being able to access their funds anymore. In order to tackle this issue, the reconciliation service has been built as part of the latest system upgrade to restore access of the migrated funds to their owners. 

**Such service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds during the stake migration.** This means that if you are unable to access your funds for any other reason (e.g. being hacked), then the reconciliation service is not applicable to you and we advise you to do not fill in the form to regain access to your funds.

### Prerequisites

In order to access to this service, some prerequisites need to be satisfied. In fact, you will need to have access to:

• the **Fetch wallet** which needs to be configured with the destination address towards which the funds should be recovered to and which will be used when connecting to the reconciliation site. 

   **NOTE: This must have at least one transaction previously recorded on the network from your address to be able to submit the form. If you have never used it in a transaction before, the reconciliation tool and the network have no way of knowing your wallet exists and will not allow you to complete the final submission.** 

• at least **1 Native FET token** in your wallet so you can pay the transaction fee associated with the reconciliation tool. If you are unable to acquire them, you can get some native FET from Indacoin (visit: <https://indacoin.io/buy-fetch.ai-with-card>) using your VISA or Mastercard to pay for the registered transaction to verify your reconciliation request. 

• your **Metamask wallet** configured with the address which was initially used in the original staking platform.

Once your registered transaction is successful and your reconciliation request has been deemed valid, the funds will be automatically distributed to your Mainnet address on the Fetch wallet. 

If you have these ready, to begin the reconciliation service visit: <https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation> and follow the instructions.
