Agent World 4 (AW-4) is the fourth part of our agent-themed incentivised testnet. It allows anyone with FET tokens to gain additional FET by re-using and adapting agents from AW-2/3 in order to continuously have a large population of agents live and engage in exchange.


## Rewards

The following table shows the incentive rewards on offer.

## How to qualify for incentive rewards?

<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>You must complete <a href="../quickstart-aw1">AW-1</a> before continuing!</p>
</div>

You have to complete a few steps as listed below:

<ol>
<li> Make sure you use the latest AEA framework version <a href="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aea" target="_blank"><img alt="PyPI" src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aea" /></a>. To upgrade from an older version use <code>pip install --upgrade aea[all]</code>.

<li> Fetch a seller AEA built during AW-2/3 from the AEA-registry and give it a suitable name:

<ul>
<li> Run <code>aea fetch PUBLIC_ID --alias YOUR_AEA_NAME</code>, where <code>YOUR_AEA_NAME</code> is replaced with a name of your choice. You can take any of your own public IDs or one from  <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/list">this list</a> which is compatible with Agent World 2. We did not verify the individual projects and take no responsibility for them working. (You have the option to create your own following the <a href="../quickstart-aw1">AW-2 guide</a>.)</li>
<li> After fetching it, enter the project: <code>cd YOUR_AEA_NAME</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition note">
  <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
  <p>If you are using an AEA which has been developed for a version of the AEA framework lower than <code>0.9.0</code> then please follow these steps to upgrade it:
  <ol>
  <li> Run <code>aea upgrade</code> from within your AEA project. If you have any errors during this step then please log them <a href="https://github.com/fetchai/agents-aea/issues">as a GitHub issue</a> and reach out on Discord. Additional instructions can be found <a href="../../aea/upgrading" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li> Update the configuration of the p2p connection by running <code>aea config set --type dict vendor.fetchai.connections.p2p_libp2p.config '{"delegate_uri": null, "entry_peers": ["/dns4/acn.fetch.ai/tcp/9001/p2p/16Uiu2HAmVWnopQAqq4pniYLw44VRvYxBUoRHqjz1Hh2SoCyjbyRW"], "public_uri": null}'</code> from within your AEA project.</li>
  </ol>
  If you are unsuccessful in upgrading your AEA then we suggest starting with a fresh AEA as described in the <a href="../quickstart-aw2">AW-2 guide</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<ul>
<li> Then install its third-party dependencies: <code>aea install</code></li>
<li> Then run <code>aea build</code> from within your AEA project to build its dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<li>Ensure you use the private key from AW1.
<ul>
<li> Generate a new key and add it to the AEA: <code>aea generate-key fetchai</code> and <code>aea add-key fetchai</code></li>
<li> Manually replace the private key you just generated in <code>fetchai_private_key.txt</code> with the one from AW-1.</li>
<li> Check everything works by running <code>aea get-address fetchai</code> and confirming that the address matches the one you hold Agent World funds on. (This can be done by viewing the address on the <a href="https://explore-agentworld.prod.fetch-ai.com" target="_blank">block explorer</a> or by typing <code>aea get-wealth fetchai</code>).</li>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Create a proof of representation for communication on the <a href="../../aea/acn">ACN</a>:
<ul>
<li> Run <code>aea generate-key fetchai fetchai_connection_private_key.txt</code> and <code>aea add-key fetchai fetchai_connection_private_key.txt --connection</code> to add a key pair for your AEA to secure its communications with. Now associate this key pair with the one you use for transacting by executing <code>aea issue-certificates</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> Configure or customize the AEA. The following requirements must be satisfied for the seller AEA (look at <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/agent/fetchai/simple_seller_aw2/0.7.0" target="_blank">fetchai/simple_seller_aw2</a> for an example):

<ul>
<li>Agent must sell data offered by some public API. The data must be related to mobility or weather. The advertisement must include the correct service key (<code>seller_service</code>) and value (one of <code>weather_data</code> or <code>mobility_data</code>, depending on the data your agent is offering). The agent must have a <code>classification</code> with piece <code>classification</code> and value <code>seller</code> and a <code>personality_data</code> with piece <code>genus</code> and value <code>data</code>. </li>
<li>Agent must sell data following the fipa protocol (<code>fetchai/fipa</code>) and advertise it using oef search protocol (<code>fetchai/oef_search</code>) on the SOEF (advertisement must include correct classification and public id of agent)</li>
<li>Payment must be via a simple transfer on the incentivized testnet.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li> Run agent and sell as much data to one of our buyer agents as possible.
