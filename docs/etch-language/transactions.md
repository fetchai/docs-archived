<h1>Transactions</h1>

Smart contracts are user-defined transactions. 

A transaction takes place between two or more parties and the data exchange is recorded on the ledger.

`etch` supports a number of transactions commonly supported by cryptographic ledgers. 

Currently, these are built-in transaction types executed in Python which have relatively fixed data storage requirements. For example:

* Transaction
* Deed
* Wealth

!!! note 
	Coming soon: support for smart contract transaction types.
