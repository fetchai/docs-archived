<h1>Machine learning and AI</h1>

!!! note

	Coming soon: machine learning and AI libraries for `etch` smart contracts. 

	The libraries will support:

	* Tensors.
	* Graphs.
	* Graph operations (MatMul, convolution, etc.).
	* Activations (relu, sigmoid, softmax, etc.).
	* Loss Functions (MeanSquareError, CrossEntropy, KLDivergence, etc.).
	* DataLoaders.
