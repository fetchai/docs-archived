<h1>States</h1>

Smart contracts store data on the Fetch.AI distributed ledger using `State` data structures.

A `State` is declared as a `State<ValueType>(name : String)` like this:

``` c++
var myState = State<Int32>("account");
```

Now we can set a value on the `State` with `set()`:

``` c++
myState.set(100);
```

And retrieve the value with `get()`:
``` c++
myState.get();
```

The `State` constructor value inside the parentheses is a pointer to a memory location on the ledger. It takes a string, as above, or an `Address` type.

``` c++
function main()

    var account = Address("2ifr5dSFRAnXexBMC3HYEVp3JHSuz7KBPXWDRBV4xdFrqGy6R9");
    var myState = State<Int32>(account);
    myState.set(100);
    printLn("My state value = " + toString(myState.get()));

endfunction
```

Any number of `var` identifiers can point to the same `State` object.

In the example below, `ownerState` and `contractState` point to the same memory location and therefore reference the same `State` object on the ledger.


``` c++
function main()

  var owner = Address("2ifr5dSFRAnXexBMC3HYEVp3JHSuz7KBPXWDRBV4xdFrqGy6R9");
  var ownerState = State<Int32>(owner);
  ownerState.set(333);
  printLn("My state value = " + toString(ownerState.get()));
  var contractState = State<Int32>(owner);
  // printLn("My state value = " + toString(contractState.get())); // runtime error: line 7: The state does not represent any value. 
  //The value has not been assigned and/or it does not exist in data storage.

endfunction
```

Attempting to print the value of the second `State` generates an error. This is because the data set in `ownerState` has not yet been written to storage, so when `contractState` tries to access it, it finds no value and this generates a runtime error.


## Writing `State` data to the ledger

Currently, `State` data is written to the ledger only after control has passed out of scope and the `destructor()` function has been called behind the scenes.

While the `State` variables are still in function scope, data is written to an intermediate object cache mechanism.

Once control reaches the end of the function, data is written to an intermediate ledger cache mechanism.

Once control has reached the end of the contract, and no errors have arisen, the data is etched upon the ledger.


## Anonymous `State` types

Declaring an anonymous `State` type without a `var` name performs an immediate data write.

``` c++
function main()
  
  State<String>("account1").set("owner1_name");

  var account1 = State<String>("account1");
  printLn(account1.get());

endfunction
```


## Default values

Although it is possible to declare a `State` without a value, attempting to `get()` from such a `State` results in a runtime error.

``` c++
function main()

  State<Int32>("myNumber");
  // printLn(State<Int32>("myNumber").get());
  // The state does not represent any value. 
  // The value has not been assigned and/or it does not exist in data storage.

  var x = State<Int32>("myNumber2");
  // printLn(x.get());
  // The state does not represent any value. 
  // The value has not been assigned and/or it does not exist in data storage.

endfunction
```



##Â Passing States around

The following code shows the behaviour of `State` types as they are passed around functions.

Any `State` value out of original scope is available to `get()`.


``` c++
function main()

  var myState = State<Int32>("contract_owner_balance");
  myState.set(33);
  printLn(toString(myState.get()));
  // PRINTS 33

  change_state(myState);
  printLn(toString(myState.get()));
  // PRINTS 44

  var result = query();
  printLn(toString(result));
  // PRINTS 55

endfunction


function change_state(state : State<Int32>)

  // you can pass around a State parameter and get access to the original state
  var newState = state;
  newState.set(44);

  // a new state with pointer = "balance"
  var anotherState = State<Int32>("balance");
  anotherState.set(55);
  // all states from this function are written now
endfunction


function query() : Int32

  // accessing the State at pointer = "balance", a value out of scope 
  var myState = State<Int32>("balance");
  // returns the 55 set in change_state()
  return myState.get();

endfunction
```

## Common use

A common use for the `State` type is to represent account owner `Address` types with their respective balances. To this end, you can declare a `State` where the first parameter is an `Address` type.

In the code below we first create an `Address` type. We can then define the transaction sender account wrapped in a `State` type where the first parameter `from` is the `Address` we just created and the second parameter is the account balance in `UInt64`:

``` c++
function main()

  var from = Address("2ifr5dSFRAnXexBMC3HYEVp3JHSuz7KBPXWDRBV4xdFrqGy6R9");
  var from_account = State<UInt64>(from);
  from_account.set(100u64);

endfunction
```
