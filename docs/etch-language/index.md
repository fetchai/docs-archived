<h2>What's <code>etch</code>?</h2>

`etch` is a high-level, statically-typed programming language designed for creating smart contracts on the Fetch.AI Constellation ledger. Unlike similar languages, `etch` allows developers to code advanced compute-intensive logic for high performance scenarios such as machine learning and AI.

The Fetch.AI ledger (known as Constellation) runs compiled `etch` bytecode that is extremely robust to ensure maximum hardware-optimised performance.

The `etch` language imposes rigorous compilation restrictions in order to avoid unwelcome and costly runtime errors. 

!!! note "Please note:"
    The `etch` language and the `etch` language guide are work in progress so some areas of the language remain incomplete for now. Please try out as much code as you like and send us your examples. Let us know if you have any problems.
