# Reconciliation service

The [reconciliation service](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) has been built as part of the latest system upgrade to restore access of the migrated funds to their owners. On September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai main-net. In this event, some users decided to wait for reconciliation to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete. However, this resulted in some users not being able to access their funds anymore. 

**Such service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds during the stake migration. If you are unable to access your funds for any other reason, then the reconciliation service is not applicable to you and we advise you to do not fill in the form to regain access to your funds.**

## Prerequisites

You will need to have access to:

• a [**Fetch wallet**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fetch-wallet/ellkdbaphhldpeajbepobaecooaoafpg).

   **NOTE: At least one transaction needs to be previously recorded on the network from your address to be able to submit the form. If you have never used this wallet in a transaction before, the reconciliation tool and the network will not recognize the wallet and will not allow you to complete the final submission.** 

• at least [**1 Native FET token**](../native_and_erc20_fets) in your wallet to pay the transaction fee associated with the reconciliation tool.

• a [**Metamask wallet**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

Once your registered transaction is successful and your reconciliation request has been deemed valid, the funds will be automatically distributed to your main-net address on the Fetch wallet.
