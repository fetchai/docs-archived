# Reconciliation service

During the _stake migration from ETH to the Fetch Mainnet_ on September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated 
from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai Mainnet. However, some users decided to opt to wait for 
reconciliation to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete. This resulted in users not being able to 
access their funds anymore. In order to tackle this issue, the reconciliation service has been built as part of the 
latest system upgrade to restore access of the migrated funds to their owners. 

**Such service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds 
during the stake migration**. This means that if you are unable to access your funds for any other reason (e.g. being 
hacked), then the reconciliation service is not applicable to you and we advise you to do not fill in the form to regain 
access to your funds.

# Reconciliation service

During the stake migration from ETH to the Fetch Main-net on September 14th, 2021, the staked funds were all migrated 
from the Ethereum staking contract to the Fetch.ai Main-net. However, some users decided to wait for reconciliation 
to access their funds after the auto-migration was complete. This resulted in users not being able to access their funds 
anymore. The [reconciliation service](https://browse-fetchhub.fetch.ai/reconciliation) has been 
built as part of the latest system upgrade to restore access of the migrated funds to their owners. 

**Such service is specifically for those users who opted to not use the guides to gain access to their staked funds 
during the stake migration.** 

This means that if you are unable to access your funds for any other reason, then the reconciliation service is not 
applicable to you and we advise you to do not fill in the form to regain access to your funds.

### Prerequisites

To access to this service you will need to have access to:

• your **Fetch wallet**

   **NOTE: At least one transaction needs to be previously recorded on the network from your address to be able to 
   submit the form. If you have never used this wallet in a transaction before, the reconciliation tool and the network
   have no way of knowing your wallet exists and will not allow you to complete the final submission.** 

• at least **1 Native FET token** in your wallet to pay the transaction fee associated with the reconciliation tool.

• your **Metamask wallet**.

Once your registered transaction is successful and your reconciliation request has been deemed valid, the funds will be
automatically distributed to your main-net address on the Fetch wallet.
