<H1>Synergetic contracts</H1>

Synergetic contracts are a new type of smart contract which allow miners to use their computational power to solve useful problems and earn a reward.

Anyone can register a problem on the ledger by creating a synergetic contract and inviting miners to solve it. 

The type of problems that synergetic contracts can solve are complex optimisation problems such as <a href="https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/aug2018/The-Optimized-Algorithm-For-Prioritizing-And-Scheduling-Of-Patient-Appointment-At-A-Health-Center-According-To-The-Highest-Rating-In-Waiting-Queue.pdf" target=_blank>scheduling patient appointments</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding" target=_blank>protein folding</a>.

A miner registers as a participant of the synergetic contract and starts calculating from a random seed generated from a public key.

Registered miners begin to solve the problem **at the same time** and the miner who solves the problem first wins the bounty associated with the problem. 

!!! Note
	The winning miner is not necessarily the miner who verifies the block.
